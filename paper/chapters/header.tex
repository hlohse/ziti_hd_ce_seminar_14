\begin{abstract}
Traditionally, High Performance Computing (HPC) applications require parallelized processing to handle input data and runtimes. Heterogenous systems for specialized computations are advantegeous. Today's consumer electronics are heterogenous multiprocessor systems equipped with web browsers. The latter provide portability for applications. This work analyzes the current state of web browser technologies for portable HPC purposes.

asm.js allows optimized JavaScript execution. HTML5 Web Workers are threads communicating via message passing allowing intra-node processing. WebRTC DataChannel is a configurable peer-to-peer socket for inter-node processing. WebCL and OpenGL Compute Shaders are GPU computing candidates.
